  SQL Challenges
</h1>

This repository showcases my ability to tackle various SQL challenges, including my solution to the Data with Danny **[#8WeekSQLChallenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com)**, and also demonstrates my proficiency in SQL for problem-solving.

For these challenges I loaded the data into PostgreSQL for the analysis, some of my solutions may not work across different SQL platforms due to differences in function naming and availability.
